## 📜 Why PANDA?
While Chinese is one of the most widely spoken languages globally, **publicly available resources for Chinese counterspeech are extremely scarce**. To address this gap, **PANDA** offers:
1. **The first Mandarin Chinese dataset** that pairs hate speech (HS) and **automatically + human-curated counterspeech (CS)** responses.  
2. **Context-rich annotations** from multiple open-source Chinese hate speech datasets, combined with newly generated counterspeech.  
3. **Human Labled Hate speech** data from previous hate speech datasets were rescored by humans for more accurate results.

## 📜 Dataset Overview
- **Total HS–CS Rows**: 784  
- **Language**: Simplified Chinese (with some code-switched English in certain cases)  
- **Sources of Hate Speech**:  
  - **COLD** [(Zhang et al., 2020)](https://github.com/link/to/cold)  
  - **SWSR** [(Li et al., 2021)](https://github.com/link/to/swsr)  
  - **CHSD** [(Wu et al., 2022)](https://github.com/link/to/chsd)  

These sources were chosen for their open-source availability and coverage of various hate/offensive scenarios, such as **sexism**, **racism**, **regional bias**, **anti-LGBTQ**, and **general offensive content**.

### Dataset Structure
The dataset is provided as a single CSV file named `panda_dataset.csv`, consisting of the following columns:

| **Column Name**          | **Description**                                                                |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `hatespeech`             | The input text being evaluated for hateful or problematic content.             |
| `hateScore`              | Counterspeech: -1; Neutral or Ambiguous: 0; Hate Speech: 1                     |
| `userEnteredResponse`    | The human entered response addressing the content of the `hatespeech`.      |
| `generatedResponse1`     | The first AI-generated response to the `hatespeech` text.                      |
| `generatedResponse2`     | The second AI-generated response to the `hatespeech` text.                     |
| `generatedResponse3`     | The third AI-generated response to the `hatespeech` text.                      |
| `generatedResponse4`     | The fourth AI-generated response to the `hatespeech` text.                     |


Generated responses 1-4 are ordred by the JudgeLM score they recived from a round robin tournament comparing each AI generated answer.
As such, `generatedResponse1` would be the most prefered AI answer by JudgeLM and `generatedResponse4` would be the least perfered of the 4.

## 📜 How the Dataset Was Created
1. **Data Collection**: We aggregated hateful/offensive posts from the above-mentioned **open-source** Chinese datasets.  
2. **Pre-filtering**: We applied an LLM-based scoring to isolate texts that are likely to be hate speech, refining them based on length and predicted toxicity.  
3. **Counterspeech Generation**: We used a **simulated annealing** method with multiple LLMs to generate 4 distinct CS responses for each HS instance.  
4. **Round-Robin Ranking**: A specialized LLM-as-a-Judge (JudgeLM) scored these CS responses in a pairwise, round-robin manner, and we preserved final ranks.  
5. **Human Annotation**: Human reviewers then selected the best CS from the 4 candidates, optionally revised it for accuracy and fluency, and labeled each final pair.  

**Important Note**: Despite this multi-layer curation process, there may still be edge cases or subjective instances in which the line between hateful speech and other forms of negativity is blurred.

## 📜 Usage
- **Hate Speech Detection Research**: Train or fine-tune classification models to detect specific hateful content in Chinese.
- **Counterspeech Modeling**: Fine-tune or evaluate generative models that produce context-sensitive counterspeech in Chinese.
- **Behavioral/Social Studies**: Examine the effectiveness of different counterspeech strategies in mitigating hateful content online.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Investigate how prompts can guide LLMs to generate more empathetic or persuasive responses.
